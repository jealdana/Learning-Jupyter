# Learning-Jupyter

In this notebook I'll explain the basic features that Jupyter (iPython) notebooks have. This will be an introduction
for the next steps on the documentation of scientific publications.

#Intalling Jupyter

In order to start creating new Jupyter notebooks I recommend you to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).
By installing Anaconda you will have installed by default Jupyter.

##Now you can start your journey through Jupyter documentation!!!
