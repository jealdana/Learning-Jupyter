# Learning-Jupyter

In this notebook I'll explain the basic features that Jupyter (iPython) notebooks have. This will be an introduction
for the next steps on the documentation of scientific publications.

# Why do I recommend to explore Jupyter?

If you need to **explain step by step your code** or you want to ensure that every piece/block of code follows the business logic or the purpose of the general idea you need tools that make you life easier and that's why Jupyter is one tool that can do it. It supports [**more than 40 programming languages**][languages] included *Python, R, Java, Matlab*, etc.. Also this tool will teach you an intuitive sintax (Markdown) for scientific documentation and it will create webpages of that content for you. So you can have your **notebooks**, **publish** them and **increase your exposure** around the world. 

Here I leave a short videos saying the relevance of this tool to science:

#Intalling Jupyter

In order to start creating new Jupyter notebooks I recommend you to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).
By installing Anaconda you will have installed by default Jupyter.

I leave you with an example from J. R. Johansson about "[QuTiP lecture: Vacuum Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Jaynes-Cumming-model.ipynb)"

##Now you can start your journey through Jupyter documentation!!!
