# Learning-Jupyter

In this notebook I'll explain the basic features that Jupyter (iPython) notebooks have. This will be an introduction
for the next steps on the documentation of scientific publications.

#Intalling Jupyter

In order to start creating new Jupyter notebooks I recommend you to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).
By installing Anaconda you will have installed by default Jupyter.

I leave you with an example from J. R. Johansson about "[QuTiP lecture: Vacuum Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Jaynes-Cumming-model.ipynb)"

##Now you can start your journey through Jupyter documentation!!!
